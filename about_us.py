    ## io.net: Revolutionizing Access to GPU Computing

    At io.net, we're on a mission to democratize access to GPU computing power. Our decentralized network aggregates underutilized GPUs from independent data centers, crypto miners, and individual owners, transforming them into a robust, scalable infrastructure. This approach not only addresses the global GPU shortage but also empowers AI startups and developers with affordable, scalable compute resources. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

    ## Our Origins

    Before June 2022, io.net focused on developing institutional-grade quantitative trading systems for both the U.S. stock market and the cryptocurrency market. Our primary challenge was constructing the infrastructure necessary to accommodate our complex needs, which included a robust backend trading system with significant computational power. 

    ## IO Intelligence: Empowering Developers with AI Tools

    Building on our decentralized GPU network, we've launched IO Intelligenceâ€”an AI infrastructure and API platform that democratizes access to advanced AI models and agents. IO Intelligence enables users to seamlessly integrate pre-trained open-source models and custom AI agents into their applications via straightforward API calls.
